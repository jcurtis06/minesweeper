### How to Play
The goal is to reveal all safe squares, or flag all the bombs. At the start of the game, all squares are hidden. Tap/left click while in mining mode to mine and reveal some of the tiles. Some tiles will have numbers. This tells you how many bombs are adjacent/next to the square with the number. If you think there is a bomb on a square, switch into mine mode and left click the square, or right click if you are on a computer. Reveal all the bombs to win.
